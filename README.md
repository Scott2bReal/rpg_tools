# RPG Tools

A set of tools to keep track of character information for Tabletop Roleplaying
Games. Also includes a dice roller!

Made as my final project for Harvard's CS50

## Features

* Dice Roller
* User Accounts
* HP Tracker

### Dice Roller 

The site includes a simple dice roller, which does not need an account to use.
Originally I made a dice rolling app in Python, which worked perfectly via the
command line. However, I realized quickly that it was not the most practical
implementation when trying to integrate it into this web app. I rewrote the
program in Javascript in order to increase performance, and reduce the need for
multiple requests.

### User Accounts

I made user accounts because I wanted to make something that my friends with
whom I played these games could use in addition to me. I designed the database
(rpg\_tools.db)
